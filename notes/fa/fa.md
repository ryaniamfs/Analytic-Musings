## Overview

Note: as of May 26 I am building out my data pipelines/datasets/scrapers first which are almost done (though it will expand on a rolling basis as I have more ideas). I am then going to do signal research to test my ideas which are below. My aim is to start by 26/27 (aka September), fundamental 2x1 across big 5 leagues. So, the research and backtesting will be done across the World Cup and pre-season.

What are we doing? We are observing patterns that happen in situations. We then ask, how can we generalize our quantify this pattern? Can we model it? 

For football analytics - I believe there are 3 main problems:


* Overlapping effects - When we see some outcome or effect in football, we know there are a myriad of contributing factors. The question is how to orthogonalize out effects we know to isolate the idiosyncratic return. For example, consider the problem of assessing managers.
* Counterfactuals (Neyman-Rubin) - When we look at stats, they are context dependent (see first point). The team affects the player's stats and the players individual contributions affects the team.
* The Eye Test - How do we quantify what we see with our eyes into statistics? And vice versa? 


## Results Betting

The core would be a **predictive model** that takes in features and outputs signals/predictions, feeding into another **trading layer (risk management/bet sizing)** + a dicsretionary layer of adjustments (e.g from watching games + reading fan forums to understand the situation) to output trades, and we **rebalance/bet weekly**.

The key idea is: how much signal does past information of football matches have in the outcome of the next match?

The core problem is: How do we translate football wisdom or tropes into statistical signals? Tropes that we see play out in matches, before games, across seasons etc. From being a dedicated fan of a team.

The bottom line is, I believe we can see with our eyes and common sense, we know there are certain things that affect the outcomes of matches. We can observe certain **narratives** or **subplots** playing out over the course of a season My question is - can they be quantified?

### Problems


* **Outlier/Anti-Narrative Problem**
    * A team projected to perform well at the start of a season chokes. Tottenham this season, Liverpool this season. Vice versa: the Bournemouth bull run. In the past, the Leicester bull run. These are outliers.
    * How do you account for outliers in a model? My guess is, if you can't predict them, then don't fight against them. Let the model pick it up and ride the trend.
    * A good test for any model is how well it picks up on the anti-narratives or outliers playing out in real time. For example, if you see the fan channels in 25/26 pre-season, everyone and their mother was glazing Liverpool. Wirtz and Isak are going to destroy the league! Literally nobody could have predicted this. Just like 100 days into the war and oil at 90s... who would have thought?
    * So a model needs to be able to identify these anti-narratives happening in real time and pick up on the trend. 
* **Cold Start Problem**
    * Key Idea - Any points/league weighted feature suffers from the lack of data at the start of a season. Use a weighting scheme from past season.
    * Problems - Plus take into account squad value? Difficult due to lookahead bias of squad/wages
* **Team Strength Problem**
    * Any summarized match/game metric is inflated/deflated by the delta of team strength.
    * For example, a strong team is naturally expected to generate high XG against a weaker team.
* **Game State Weighing Problem**
    * Any summarized match/game metric like XG/XA, PPDA, field tilt, xT are aggregated.
    * These variables fluctuate by game state. Hence, we need time series metrics within game to weigh these metrics.
    * For example, a team going 2-0 up and dominating on XG will sit back in the 70th while the opposing team attacks more. 
    * Idea - Sofascores attacking momentum time series chart.
    * Idea - Possession/ field tilt time series
    * Idea - Score timings as a game state proxy. If we can't get time series possession or field tilt.
* **XI Release Timing Problem**
    * Do you go in before the XI is realised or right after?
    * You can have two variants of timings/approaches where in the former you take injuries to forecast availability.
    * Or you can wait for the XI to release and have that information then go in.
    * If you price XI information better than the market, then you should go in after. 
    * So there are two timing approaches for any fundamental strategy. Which one makes more money?
* **Counterexample Problem**
    * No matter how much you can find a trend or signal, there are always counterexamples.
    * E.g transfer coefficient. Wirtz vs DeBruyne, Buli CAM to EPL. One flops, the other becomes a legend.
 

### Features

* **Core Strength Feature**
    * Idea - The fundamental feature at the start of each season, a team has an innate ranking/strength level from it's players and the manager. This feature should remain relatively stable across the season.
    * Core Strength Equation - core_strength(team) = baseline (existing squad strength last season) + differential (ex-ante expected contribution/strength of incomings less ex-post contribution/strength of outgoings).
    * Evaluation - In season outcomes and baseline win rates/odds (not residual odds), since this is a "beta" feature, not "alpha".
    * Modelling - All separate features (e.g their own units/dimensions) or single (better for interpretation but harder to do)
    * Baseline - Past squad strength. Past position/points, squad value, strength scores, etc.
    * Differential - Strength of incomings (aka the ex-ante transfer problem) and strength of outgoings (this is ex-post).
    * Spending Power - Within league relative or past-position relative (for this position, say midtable, how much is usually spent?), total spent or net spend
    * Incomings - I talk about possible approaches to the ex-ante transfer problem below. For ex-ante, we have market value, prices, player ratings at past clubs. But...
    * Outgoings - Relative player performance per game, accumulated across a season, scaled to baseline or points as a measure of contribution.
    * Problem - Both baseline and differential (ins and outs) must be comparable within league and the same units! In other words, the relative strength of incomings at Liverpool must be comparable to relative strength of incomings at Bournemouth, for example. Same for relative strength of outgoings at Liverpool and Bournemouth.
    * Example - Liverpool's 25/26 window summed it up. Losing Darwin, Diaz, Trent, Jota (RIP), replacing with Frimpong, Kerkez, Wirtz, Ekitike, Isak. Combined with Salah underperfomance, the replacements in reality just failed to fill the gaps of the leavers. They had a high baseline, but such a huge negative differential (weak ins and strong outs) that it hurt their core strength badly. The question is how we quantify that. Remember - consensus ex-ante 25/26 was the ins were really really strong.
* **Core momentum feature**
    * Idea - A team that overperforms XG diff over goal diff should be winning more, a team that underperforms XG diff over goal diff should be winning less as luck is unsustainable. Aka a short window (e.g simple/exponential MA) of diffs. 
    * Idea - XG must be adjusted for team strength factor, game state factor, and structural factor (systematic over/under perf). The latter can be done by estimating a long window of diffs.
    * XG Over/underperformance of Goal Diff - Window of league/point-weighted gamestate-weighted goal differentials - Some teams structurally over/underperform their xG, based on style factors (need to research this) or just player power (e.g outrageous goals like PSG)
    * Team Strength Delta Factor - Marginal XG value varies in opponent strength. Scale the XG difference by team strength deltas. To account for team strength differences.
    * Game State Weighting Factor - Marginal XG value varies in time. E.g for goals, scale them by goal timing: 2-0 with 90' 95' is not the same as 2-0 30' 40'. For XG, create a discretized XG curve and apply a time decay. Or sofascore attacking momentum.
    * Structural Factor - Marginal XG value can vary due to structural over/underperf. E.g a team with deadly finishers and long shot specialists can consistently score low XG goals and overperform. A team with bad finishers can underperform.
* **Lineup/player selection feature**
    * Idea - How much alpha in picking the selected starting XI / subs for that opponent contributes relative to the theoretical ideal/maximum starting XI/subs. The idea sometimes managers do not pick the "best" lineup.
    * Idea - These are all (creative) functions of player ratings, assuming they are indicative of performance and past performance carries into future performance. Player ratings are proprietary functions of events/tracking data in the algo sense, and journalist human views (eye tests). We use ratings (for now) because we do not have detailed events data, nor do we have a view on how to process events/tracking data to assess performance better than the ratings providers.
    * Ratings - Use historical player ratings to measure effectiveness of the XI. Statistical/algo ratings vs journal ratings.  
    * Variant - Weighing new transfers more, as existing players have already a baseline strength from last season.
    * Variant - Weighing recent form more vs past historical form (e.g past seasons ratings with large $n$). Important for not-nailed on starters (aka Skelly in midfield banged vs Fulham replacing Zubimendi, but was poorly rated at LB in the past)
    * Variant - Weighing z-scores by position group (attackers, midfielders, defenders, GK). Relative performance to your position group instead of your squad.
    * Variant - Weighing journal vs algo. How much weight do you put in a journalist view vs an algo view? Stat padders might get artificially boosted by algos (see Gyokeres in Arsenal Atletico UCL Semi 1st leg 25/26, rated highly by BBC/Sky and fans but poorly by the algorithm. Not good.)
    * Variant - Theoretical ideal lineup construction algorithm. Player position placement matters too! Sometimes fans complain when the manager plays the player in the wrong position. (e.g when Zubimendi was failing, Arteta caved in to what us fans had been crying out for and shifted MLS from LB to CM. This led us to a title win and UCL final. So in other words, Skelly playing in CM boosted his player performance, his natural position)
* **Availability/injury feature**
    * Idea - In theory, injuries to key players can damage outcomes. Afcon is basically an injury.
    * Idea - Should be captured in player selection, but what if the ratings price a key player lower?
    * Injury Separation from Player Selection - For that reason, should have an injury feature that quantifies the importance of injured players. And we would use player ratings over historical seasons (if there any) to get this importance. What if it's a new transfer?
    * Replacement Quality Problem - In theory, a separate injury score and a player selection feature should solve the problem of the injury replacement quality option. (E.g when Ruben Dias got injured, City brought in Max Alleyne and choked out some losses on the tape before bringing Guehi in January. Arsenal's Saliba injury in 22/23 where Rob Holding stepped up caused a title collapse. In other words - the quality of the replacement can mitigate or exacerbate the injury loss.)
* **Manager Feature**
    * Managerial Alpha - We know some managers are good. For example, Carrick in 25/26 took United to top 4. How do we account for managerial alpha if we have a manager with no 
    * H2H - Some kind of H2H manager score based on past fixtures over a long period with the same team. Hypothesis being certain managers just tactically have each others number.
    * New Manager Bounce - Another trope in football. Can this add a boost to certain matches with a new manager bounce? But this is confounded to manager skill track record? Usually happens as a firing manager is underperforming, by definition.
* **Fatigue/Congestion/Rotation feature (minutes dispersion)**
    * Idea - Idea being playing too many games in a tight schedule does impact performance vs well-rested. 
    * Example - Need to find examples where teams bust a gut early in the season, and towards the tail end, they collapse (e.g Arteta & Klopp Arsenal April collapse). Usually accompanied by a congested schedule and injury pileup.
    * Feature - Fixture count, distance ran, pressing intensity, degree of rotation/substitutions/minutes played dispersion, all impact fatigue. Especially deep in cup runs. Kind of kicks in the last months of a season with a drastic collapse. Hence the birth of the April collapse.
* **Motivation feature**
    * Idea - Some kind of motivation score differential. Idea being that nearing end of season, say last 5 games (GW34), we have teams with increased and decreased motivation.
    * Example - Relegation teams fighting end of the season.
    * Example - Mid table teams with no ability to leapfrog in the table or cannot qualify for the next tier competition (CL, UEL, Conference)
    * Example - Title winners having won already end of season (doesn't happen often in EPL though unlike BL or L1) with no motivation.
    * Example - Sometimes, teams with nothing to play for rest players for a big game. 
    * Feature - Some kind of score that increases or decreases depending on the position in table and number of games left
* **Style feature**
    * Idea - The idea that certain teams styles e.g high pressing, possession, counterattack, can neutralize or be (dis) advantaged versus another style. 
    * Idea - This style matchup more or less overpowers any strength-difference features to produce a contrarian result that is "unexpected". We will use match aggregate statistics for this. But it is subjected to the game state problem: a match statistic is aggregated across the game state time series. 
    * Confounding with Game State - Styles can change within a match. For example, a team might switch from high pressing to sitting back after taking a 2-0 lead.
    * Confounding with Opponent - This is a bigger factor as a team might play different styles versus different opponents! For example, a relegation team might play a low block to frustrate a much stronger opponent (because they simply don't have the skill to play attacking vs a stronger team) and come away with a narrow draw. But, the same team, facing a less strong opponent, say, midtablem might open up and lose because of that. 
    * Bogey Team Trope - The football trope of a "bogey team" seems to imply the existence of style advantage and disadvantage. A comment from ["Why is Spurs of all teams our Kryptonite" from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MCFC/comments/1ip9wuk/why_is_spurs_of_all_teams_our_kryptonite_cant/) - Says "Rock Paper Scissors innit". There must be some wisdom in this trope if fans latently express it.
    * Player Balance - Two important things come to mind: midfield balance (how good at attack and defense a midfield pair/trio is) and attack pace (how fast are the wingers) and height/heading (how good are the defenders at heading). We can quantify these with FC ratings or player statistics. 
    * Style Negation/Aggravation (SNA) - Certain teams might be good at overcoming style mismatches: for example, a low block could be broken if a team has lots of verticality, dribblers, longshot specialists, or midfielders that break lines/take risks, or a target man to spam crosses into. A team might be good at preventing counterattacks simply by having a world class DM with pace that can sweep up. E.g Declan Rice. 
    * Counterattack/Transition vs Possession/Pressing - Matchups of City vs Spurs (GW12 24/25, 23-11-24, 4-0), United vs City (GW21 25/26, 17-01-26, 2-0) come to mind. *SNA*: made worse by an attacking minded, slow, midfield vs fast attackers.
    * Low Block vs Dominant Team - Many of Arsenal's games in 25/26 come to mind. Sunderland vs Arsenal (GW11 25/26, 08-11-25, 2-2). This happens often when a stronger team plays a weak team. The weak team sets up shop. The metrics then look very lopsided as the strong team just batters the weak teams low block and the margin of victory, if any, becomes much closer than the underlying stats suggest. See Burnley vs Liverpool (GW4 25/26, 04-09-25, 0-1).  *SNA*: The amount of creative dribbling/dribblers to get past blocks, and the verticality/progressiveness of the midfielders in terms of their passing.
    * Crossing/Set Piece Vulnerability - Can't think of an example for this. *SNA*: Height difference in teams (certain distribution of height amongst positions matters more?), say crossing dominant team vs opponent backline height.  
    * FIFA/FC Ratings - From watching Egypt vs Argentina, I realized, could FIFA ratings have any use? For example, the heights of backline vs the defenders/strikers for set piece/headed goals. The pace of the wingers for counterattackers. And the defensive stats of the midfield for breaking counterattacks. For example, some managers might start an offensive midfield (two offensive minded CMs in a double pivot who don't have natural defensive instincts) and then they are very susceptible to fast wingers and counterattacks. FIFA ratings does capture the nature of player quite well. We have to normalize the stats relative to their baselines as we care about the ratio of stats, not their absolute level.
    * Residual Analysis - Once having a good model without style, back out any strange or outlier results. Infer the style mismatch from them. Problem - needs a decent model first. Also outlier matches may not be due to style mismatch.
* **Home and away feature**
    * Feature - A home team score and a away team score.
    * Key Idea - Idea being certain teams have more home/away advantage than others. Andrew Mack's SSMIE book talks about a ZSD model for this. Window of points/league weighted home points vs away points difference
    * Example - Interaction effect with referee, we know sometimes referees get swayed by the home crowd and skew decisions.
* **Referee feature**
    * Some kind of league/point-weighted referee score based on past fixtures over a long period of time with the same time.
    * Idea being that sometimes referees have biases against certain teams.
* **Informed fan feature**
    * Sharps vs Noise Fans - With any text based dataset, there will be informed, sharp fans who have accurate views about the game. There will also be fans who get it completely wrong. How can we separate the two? 
    * Pre match sentiment - For bookie upsets/high sharp logloss matches from our dashboard, we can flag these matches ex-post.  We can scan pre match threads ex-ante, or daily discussion threads, to get a sense of what fans are thinking about the chances for those outlier/high logloss games.
    * Starting XI reaction sentiment - For example, a bad lineup comes out. Fans on X or the pre-match thread or lineup thread complaining. How do I know? Because I would go immediately to the lineup and start complaining... or at least I would go there to see if other people are complaining.
    * Key Idea - Official club pages will always release XI on X and Instagram. Does the data there have any predictive power as a signal? Perhaps some kind of sentiment score? On Instagram and X.
    * Key Idea - Sentiment score differential against closing odds residual. Or some kind of discount adjustment to the final prediction odds.
    * Key Idea - This is effectively the fan's / wisdom of the crowd view on the starting XI alpha feature. For example, if fans think it is a bad lineup choice, they will be complaining the release thread. 
 * **Bookie odds feature**
    * Key Idea - The Benter boost as per Mack. Benter in his paper blended his odds/probs with bookie odds/probs in a logit model. Acts as a form of regularization/shrinkage.
    * Other Ideas - Odds dispersion, wrongness, opening vs closing delta. Need to do EDA on odds. Odds time series from bettingiscool (49euro/month).



### The Discretionary Angle  - Open Problems

* **The Player/Transfer Problem**
    * Key Idea - How much strength do incoming players contribute to core squad strength?
    * Example - Kvara signed in Jan 24/25 for PSG for 70m euros. He then made a HUGE impact in PSG for 24/25 and 25/26 CL runs, responsible for their CL dominance.
    * Example - Wirtz signed in July for 25/26 for Liverpool for 120m euros. He then played a HUGE role in flopping (Flopian Wirtz as they call him) and is a reason why Liverpool sucked in 25/26. He couldn't cut it. 120m budget would score high in our feature.
    * Idea - Opponent-strength weighted average player ratings - If we have past WhoScored ratings, we can discount them for opponent strength. Inspired by the -7 Wirtz comment. However, problem is, need to adjust by league position and league strength!
    * Idea - Transfer Coefficient - Some have suggested a "transfer coefficient" + UEFA coefficients.
    * Idea - Discretionary Blend - Scout the transfers and assign a score to each squad. Then apply that to a transfer score across summer/winter. Make intential lookahead bias by forming transfer score feature for teams by looking at ex-post EOS grades (e.g market value). Test if it improves performance. Then if live season, scout and make discretionary scores from YouTube.
    * Idea - On the Fly Weighting - Move the transfer problem into the player selection feature. Heavily weigh the new signings ratings more in the strength of squad
    * Idea - Styles - For a certain position, for a transfer from league X to Y, maybe styles have to do with it? In other words, the attributes of the player. Then, we can use FIFA/EAFC ratings to quantify (e.g weak and slow usually does not translate to PL). But this is a big stretch so... I really doubt there is any signal in fricking FIFA ratings.
    * The Wirtz Problem - So if you check [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1l89qfn/romano_florian_wirtz_to_liverpool_here_we_go/), you have fans glazing that mfer. But scroll down, at -7 downvotes, a comment says "He has good league numbers, but most of his production came against teams like Bremen, Freiburg, and Wolfsburg. He was disappointing in the Europa league final as well as the Euros. In last two seasons he hasn't scored or assisted against Bayern in the league as well. Then in UCL didn't play well vs Atleti, Liverpool, Bayern, with his best perfs against Brest and Feyenoord". At -7. So this guy, has successfully ex-ante made the Wirtz call. The footballing equivalent of calling the US/Iran MoU in April during peak oil. This comment says he doesn't show up in big games therefore flop. Now this gets me thinking.... can we quantify this?
* **Other Factors Influencing Transfers (Not Modellable)**
    * Manager Misprofiling - Manager misprofiles a player. Uses him in a role/position he is not suited too. Poor management.
    * Poor Tactical Fit - Player struggles to adapt into a new tactical system. This in theory is modellable, but it means we need to model tactics/styles for all clubs that transfer into the big 5! Crazy stuff.
    * Homesickness/Culture Fit - Player struggles to adapt to playing in a foreign culture. See Angel Di Maria to United under Van Gaal, 14/15 season. 
* **The Manager Problem**
    * Key Idea - Quantifying manager performance. We know managers have alpha and beta. Alpha being their idio return and beta being their factor returns (current squad, budget, support). Can we isolate the alpha or idio returns of each manager, netting off the effects of their current squad wages and net spend over their tenure?
    * Key Idea - Regress wages and net spend on league position, across all leagues in cross section, across multiple seasons.  If a manager consistently has a high ranked residual, across tenures, then you have to say maybe...that's the skill.
    * Key Idea - However, important to remember when you include managerial alpha in the model, the alpha must be re-calculated to exclude everything after and the current season you are modelling! If not, lookahead bias. 
    * Problem - Does not take into account the intrinsic value of transfers over/under their budget. E.g was Iraola carrying Bournemouth or was Rayan carrying Iraola?

## Research Directions

* **Correlation Directions**
    * Correlative research
        * Standard signal/model research. Based on a hypothesis, quantify the hypothesis, test the idea. Is there predictive power?
    * Anti-Correlative Research
        * The key idea here is to find situations/matches where the feature, model (be it yours or bookie) failed or diverged dramatically. 
        * Then do investigative research. What happened there? Could the feature/model have priced it in? If so, what did we miss? If not, how can we neutralize this risk? 
* **Correlation Types**
    * Season correlations
        * For season-level features, we have the extra option of scattering against season outcomes (e.g points or league ranking)
    * Fixture correlations
        * Where we take the difference in two scores of a feature for home and away and use that is a predictor of win probabilities.
* **Discretionary Research**
    * Discretionary Overlay
        * For EPL, since I'm an Arsenal fan anyway, I might extend to watch all EPL games and understand what the fans of each club are thinking at each point in time across a season. Then, I would consider doing a semi-systematic blend with discretionary betting. Aka I watch games, read fan forums, form my views, and also use my model outputs in a discretionary way to inform betting decisions.
    * Transfer Scouting
        * Good old YouTube scouting to tell if a transfer prospect is any good.
    * Game Watching
        * Obviously, we will aim to watch as many games as possible. I can cover EPL and watch every game, but to cover big 5 is a stretch. 
    * Fan forums and media 
        * Reddits, forums etc. It is important to keep track what the fans are saying, how they complain about lineup choices, what they think of transfers, how they think the team or players performed in a game.
    * Limitation
        * Breadth in the cross section is problematic - I probably only have time to cover extensively one league. Fan forums in non-English is a challenge also. 


## Modelling Directions

* **Setup** 
    * Rolling window
        * In this approach, the season-fixed features like the manager skill, core strength would remain constant over the season goes but in theory the model should weigh them less naturally as the season goes. A rolling window does this
        * However, for a short rolling window, for first time effects, like a style mismatch, it will not have any past data to predict/learn on. So minimum needs to be one full season. Then expanding window. After round robin, aka GW19, can switch to rolling/expanding on current season.
    * Train-Val-Test
        * Not really a big fan of this ...
* **Features**
    * Aggregation/score rollup vs individual - What if instead of putting features individually, we come out with a score/index from modelling groups of features, then feed it into the final model?
    * Interpretability - Much better and we what see on the pitch.
    * Rollup scores - Manager score, squad strength score (baseline + differential), momentum/form score, player selection/injury score, fatigue/congestion score, style score.
    * Attribution - E.g lose game because of big injuries. Lose game because looking tired in the 2nd half due to season-accumulating fatigue. Lose game because tactically outmatched by a style.



## Datasets Not Spanned

* Complex in-game play-by-play events data, from StatsBomb or Opta. Proprietary, used by scouts, expensive.
* PLayer in-game statistics. Per game, aggregated from the former. Do these have any use? It tells you how a player performed / what he did in a game, beyond just the player ratings. Ratings are a function of this.


## Non-Betting Ideas

### Player Assessment with Stats

How do we optimally make use of statistics to scout players? Say, examine successful players per position - take a look at their stats, extrapolate to scout new players. Like factors driving returns.

* Find a measure of player success per position. E.g market value/wages normalized by age or players, or highest mkt val increase. 
* For the most successful and least successful players: find statistics that impact that the most.
* Can be used as scouting tool for transfers by just looking at statistics

More detailed plan:

* Determine a target variable that is a proxy of player success: For each starting age/year of birth, for each position, for each year, sort players with highest increase in market values forward over next $t$ years. For example.
* Have some treatment for the statistics per player on a team/league level to take into account the influence of team/league on statistics. Aka orthogonalize out against the team/league factors. E.g Wirtz playing in B04, an attacking team, in a farmers league (BuLi).
* Regress residualized statistics across years/seasons against target.
* Take the statistics with most impact / highest coefficients

Problem:

* Finding the right dependent variable is difficult. Many ways to construct it. 
* Statistics generated by players in matches are dependent on their team and league. For example, the argument that Portugese league strikers score tonnes of goals but flop in the higher leagues when they transfer.

### Player Assessment with Physical Attributes

Are there optimal physical metrics per position (arm movement, touch density, leg to torso, torso uprightness) that can determine a player's success in scouting? This relates to the eye test. For example, we can see Messi clearly has some interesting different physical attributes when he plays that contributes to his success. But how to quantify these in numbers is a problem.

### Injuries

Can we predict which teams get the most injuries? 

* Run regression with distance ran and total substitute minutes on injury time per season.
* Should be able to prove that better substitute management results in less injuries.

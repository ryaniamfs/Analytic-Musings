title: Thinking About Thinking (Metacognition)
category: productivity
---

In this post, I explore the notion that we can observe experts in different fields and distill their underlying patterns of thought via the right syntax in order to adapt the "optimal style of thought" for that field (e.g natural sciences, computation, humanities).
<!--more-->

A _field_ is just an area of study. My idea is that understanding complexity is about linking things together, but each field has different _things_, and each thing has it's own type of _link_. As we link things together, we can build a clearer visualisation in our head.

## The Right Words
I posit how to think about these _things_ and _links_ can be captured by invoking the right _word_ or _syntax_.

> We have just seen, through an example, how important words are in Mathematics. One can hardly believe how a well-chosen word can provide economy of thought.

Thus, by _observing_ experts in respective fields, like a scientist, mathematician, programmer, investor being interviewed,  and examining their _choice of words_, we can capture how they think. Sounds simple enough! 
## Fields

<p>I categorize fields (subjects of study) into three types: deterministic, semi-deterministic, and humanistic.</p>
<img src="{{ site.imageurl }}Metacognition/Page1B.png" height=350 class="center"> 

<p><b>Deterministic</b> fields are the sciences and their derived fields. Physics, mathematics, etc. These have fixed laws (of nature). </p>

<p><b>Semi-deterministic</b> fields just refers to computing: it has fixed laws that are modifiable by humans (e.g we make the laws via telling the computer what to do via programming).</p>

<p><b>Humanistic</b> fields refers to fields studying human behavior: economics, finance, history, politics, etc. The <i>laws</i> arise due to human behavior.</p>

I argue each field can be thought of in two ways: a <i>primal form</i>, involving linking things together as a <i>graph</i>, and a <i>dual</i> form, which is basically <i>visualising</i> something in your head. 

So, let's try to find the right words to express the _things_ and their _links_.

A `textual representation` is how the concept appears on text, or on paper. Aka how we learn. An `innate representation` is what we need to connect the textual representation to.

<h2>Deterministic Framework</h2>

<p>Example Fields: Mathematics, natural sciences, engineering.</p>

There are two fundamental things: <i>concepts (abstraction)</i> and <i>physical quantities</i>. On the underlying side, they are just numbers, quantities that can vary, basically. But what they represent are two different things. Their textual representation is a `symbol` and innate representation is a `visual`. 

A concept (more towards the field of mathematics) and a quantity (more towards the field of physics) are the two main players. The difference is in their treatment: both can be visualised, but the former exists in abstract space whereas the latter exists in physical space (e.g our physical reality). 

The key skill:

* Visualising the concept or quantity
* Connecting them together in a system.

Another idea is that of _dependency_, whereby to understand or make connections of certain concepts, there must be a backlog graph of existing concepts that you have to build in sequential fashion, aka prerequisites.

<p>They are linked via connections. These can be direct or latent. Direct connections are obvious. Latent ones are sudden inspirations between seemingly unrelated things. The idea is to build up a dense, well-connected network of things in your head.</p>

## Semideterministic Framework

For semi-deterministic fields, which is essentially computing, a system consists of **edges/pipes (operations/tools/parts)** and **nodes (information)**. Together, they form a graph operating at an **abstraction level**.

The key idea is to start top down. A problem here is defined as a set of target nodes and a set of destination nodes. You want to build a system using edges/pipes to get from the target nodes to the destination nodes.

And you do this via:

* **Decomposing/break** down a edge in a system into another system of nodes and edges, going to a deeper level of abstraction. 
* **Build up** a node and edge system to be a node or edge in a higher abstraction level system.

This would be top-down thinking.

There's a relatively good understanding of <i>abstraction layers</i>. Atoms, silicon, transistors, logic gates, functional units, processing elements, instruction sets, languages - abstraction layers from the atom to the datacenter.

<h2>Humanistic Framework</h2>

The humanistic framework is concerned with modelling human behavior at a macro scale (aka economics/markets, history, politics). The idea is we process nodes (data) with our minds to forecast what happens next.

A node in a situation graph can be:

* **Players/Actors** - Frame of reference. Person or organisation. Who.
* **Actions** - What/when/where/how. Non-precise visualisation (top-down map view). Context > action > reaction. Effects (assigning numbers - comparison and aggregation). 
* **Motivation** - Why? Intended outcome, context.

**Data Categorization** - Categorize data into nodes/graphs: who (identifying actors/players and putting yourself in their situation/context), why (motivation/intended outcomes), what/when/where/how (action/effect).

**Forecasting** - Processing the **above data** from a situation to **forecast** player actions. Closest analogue: building a ML model. But the model is your mind (wetware, not soft/hardware). So you need to have processes to organize data and feed into your mind to forecast player actions. To train the model = train your mind. How do we identify different data sources/flows, put them into processes, and draw conclusions/forecasts from them? It is difficult.

## Intelligence and Blending the Frameworks

Thus, intelligence is the mastery you have in these frameworks, both in the cross section (the ability to master multiple of these in breadth and blend them together) and depth (mastery into an individual framework), applied to different disciplines.

Each person has a different calibration in depth and width, applied to different disciplines, which makes them unique.

Whenever approaching any cognitive task, it is important to remember this idea of blending the frameworks in the cross section and in the time series (or depth-wise).

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

Clearly, complexity or understanding it is about linking things together and having a good mental picture of them. But different discplines have different ways to approach this. By observing interviews of experts and their thought process, we can put the right words to them and try to adapt them so we can learn faster.
